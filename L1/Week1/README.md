## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

*I am pursuing a Finance and Data Science major, with a focus on learning financial modeling, portfolio management, and risk analysis. While I was a Junior Quant in the* *program, I began working with teams to better understand financial concepts and apply Python to real-world problems. In addition to my academic work, I manage my own* *brokerage account and actively trade a portfolio of 20 investments, analyzing earnings reports and refining my investment strategies. My interest in quantitative finance* *stemmed from the challenge of using financial knowledge and data-driven strategies to optimize trading decisions. Through the program, I have also started learning the* *history of quantitative finance, including the work of Jules Regnault, whose early studies of stock price behavior contributed to the development of modern quantitative* *finance.*

## 2. Career Goals

*In the short term, I aim to work as a Quantitative Analyst, focusing on applying my knowledge of financial models, data analysis, and trading strategies to optimize market* *performance. Over the next year, I plan to continue developing my technical skills and pursue certifications in quantitative finance. In 5 years, I hope to specialize in* *algorithmic trading or quantitative research, working to develop data-driven strategies for optimizing trading. In 10 years, I aim to be at the forefront of the field,* *utilizing my expertise to lead quantitative teams, push boundaries, and drive innovation. I am particularly interested in roles that combine financial modeling, data* *analysis, and real-time data to inform decision-making.*

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

*Through this program, I hope to deepen my understanding of advanced statistical modeling, financial concepts, and risk management techniques. I aim to strengthen my skills* *in Python, especially in its application to financial modeling and trading strategies. Additionally, I want to gain hands-on experience with real-time data and improve my* *understanding of derivatives pricing and systematic trading strategies. Networking with professionals and peers is another key goal of the program, as it will provide* *valuable industry insights and career advice. Through the program, I have also gained exposure to more advanced topics in quantitative finance, which I am excited to* *explore further. Ultimately, I hope to refine my understanding of financial markets and develop the technical skills needed to succeed in quantitative finance.*
## 4. Current Technical Skills

'''•	Python: Beginner
•	Data Analysis: Beginner (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
•	Statistical Analysis: Beginner 
•	Financial Modeling: Beginner
•	Machine Learning: None
•	Version Control (Git): None
I am actively learning Python and improving my data analysis skills, and I am committed to refining these abilities to apply them more effectively in financial scenarios. Although my experience in financial analysis and data science is foundational, I plan to continue building on this knowledge, especially in quantitative finance, throughout the program. My goal is to develop proficiency in financial modeling, statistical analysis, and programming to better inform my investment strategies.'''
## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

'''During the program, I will focus on developing advanced skills in statistical modeling, financial applications of Python, and risk management techniques. I plan to work on understanding derivatives pricing and systematic trading strategies. I will measure my progress through assignments, applying concepts in my personal trading, and tracking my improvement in Python and statistical analysis. I plan to dedicate a few hours per day to studying and practicing. In addition to program materials, I will use resources such as financial modeling textbooks and online coding tutorials. Through the program, I have also learned the importance of collaboration and networking, and I plan to further develop these skills by engaging with peers and professionals. My definition of success in the program will be the mastery of key financial concepts, improved coding proficiency, and the successful application of learned strategies to real-world financial scenarios.'''

*I understand that this document will be used to track my progress throughout the program and may be referenced during career counseling sessions. I commit to working toward these goals during the Traders@SMU Alpha Program.*
